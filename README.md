# Multilingual-Wiktionary-Morphology-Extractor
The aim of this project is to extract from Wiktionary morphological paradigms for more than 300 languages, using a HTML parser.
In particular, the goal is to capture the most basic meanings encoded by inflectional morphology across all the worldâ€™s languages present in the English edition of Wiktionary and to define those meanings in a language- independent manner. 
In order to achieve this goal, a morphology extractor that operates directly on the surface HTML of Wiktionary is implemented, using an HTML parser based on Jsoup.
